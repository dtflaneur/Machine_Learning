Golang: was developed by Google to solve the problem of concurrent messaging between distributed systems in the cloud. It is a programming language that is asynchronous by default. This means that every operation you perform, like sending a message to another system, is done without waiting for the other system to respond back to you. It can handle multiple messages at any given time.
