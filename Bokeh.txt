Bokeh
- is a visualization package that focusses on offering interactive functions like zomm in pan out etc..
- offers browser based interactivity
- is declarative not procedural
- Basic building blocks of Bokeh plots are glyphs
- Outpot are html files with css & JASON object which are interpreted by javascript on the browser
- can be used with R, Python & Scala
- Seaborn is based on Matplotlib having more polished charts whereas Bokeh is not based on matplotlib
- similarly Plotly.py is not built upon matplotlib it focuses on online collaboration on visualization
- Every plot that is produced by Bokeh is serialized as JASON object & BokehJS consumes these JASON Objects to render the plot in the browser
- BoekJS renders JAON objects Bokeh.Python produces these JASON Objects
